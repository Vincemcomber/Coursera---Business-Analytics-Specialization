# Coursera---Business-Analytics-Specialization
I have successfully completed all five courses in Wharton's Business Analytics Specialization, and has gained the data literacy and analytic mindset necessary to describe, predict, and inform business decisions using big data in the specific areas of marketing, human resources, finance, and operations.

# Course 1: Customer Analytics
- Learn the major methods of customer data collection and synthesize how data can inform business decisions
- Explore causation versus correlation in business data.
- Identify main tools used for customer behavior prediction, and the appropriate uses for each tool.
- Apply the RFM (recency, frequency, monetary) principle to predict customer activity.
- FWIW: RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitively rank and group customers based on three attributes: when the customer last visited the place/site, how often they visit, and what they've purchased.
- Define a business problem and break it into objectives and goals.
- Practice optimization techniques to test into a successful solution to the identified business problem.
- Practice putting data to use in your own fictional company based on effective data-driven principles.
- Identify the different methods used by well-known firms to solve problems with data.

# Course 2: Operations Analytics
- Get introduced to underlying analytics concepts, such as random variables, descriptive statistics, common forecasting tools, and measures for judging the quality of a forecast.
- Practice building optimization models and applying them to specific business challenges.
- Learn how excel can help optimize a solution with built-in formulas.
- Practice building and reading simulation models to evaluate complex business decisions.
- Learn techniques for balancing risk and reward, and use a simulation to estimate outcomes.
- Learn about decision trees, and how they work together with optimization and simulation to solve complex problems.
- Use optimization frameworks to practice solving real problems using data.

# Course 3: People Analytics
- Understand the concept of performance evaluation and its role in the workplace.
- Learn about the four key issues in measuring performance: regression to the mean, sample size, signal independence, and process vs. outcome and how to apply them in real-world scenarios, specifically in the NFL.
- Learn about how to use data to analyze the key components of the staffing cycle: hiring, internal mobility and career development, and attrition.
- Explore different analytic approaches to predict performance for hiring and optimize internal mobility, reduce turnover and predict attrition.
- Learn the critical skill of understanding causality to avoid using data incorrectly.
- Learn the basic principles of using analytics to encourage collaboration between employees within an organization.
- Explore how data is used to describe, map, and evaluate collaboration networks, and how to intervene in collaboration networks to improve collaboration using examples from real-world companies.
- Learn how to use tools of organizational network analysis to improve collaboration patterns within an organization to make it more productive, effective, and successful.
- Learn how data may be used in talent assessment and development to maximize employee ability.
- Understand how to move from performance evaluation to a deeper analysis of employee evaluation to improve the effectiveness and equitability of the promotion process at your firm.
- Practice the four major challenges of talent analytics: context, interdependence, self-fulfilling prophecies, and reverse causality, the challenges of working with algorithms, and some practical tips for incorporating data sensitively and fairly.
- Understand the current challenges and future directions of the field of people analytics to put employee data to work in a smarter way.

# Course 4: Accounting Analytics
- Understand the concept of ratio analysis and forecasting, including how it involves financial statement numbers.
- Learn about financial statements and sources of financial data through optional review videos.
- Analyze a single company's strategy and business model, using the DuPont analysis, profitability and turnover ratios, and liquidity ratios.
- Use each of the ratios to forecast future financial statements and understand how to identify sources of potential trouble.
- Understand the concept of earnings management and its practices of trying to intentionally bias financial statements.
- Learn about means, motives and opportunity; how companies make earnings look better, their incentives for manipulating earnings, and how they get away with it.
- Be able to spot earnings management to get a more accurate picture of earnings and be able to catch some bad guys in finance reporting.
- Learn about using big data approaches to detect earnings management, specifically using prediction models to try to predict how the financial statements would look if there were no manipulation by the manager.
- Learn about Discretionary Expenditure Models, which try to model the cash portion of earnings.
- Understand Fraud Prediction Models, which try to directly predict what types of companies are likely to commit frauds.
- Explore Benford's Law and its use in detecting potentially manipulated financial statements.
- Understand the importance of linking non-financial metrics to financial performance.
- Learn how to uncover which non-financial performance measures predict financial results by asking fundamental questions such as: which are the key drivers of financial success, how to rank or weight non-financial measures and what performance targets are desirable.
- Read examples of how real-world companies use accounting analytics to show how investments in non-financial dimensions pay off in the future and the common organizational issues that can arise when using these models.
- Understand how predictive analytics can be used to determine what to measure, how to weight different performance measures, make trade-offs between short and long-term objectives, and set performance targets for optimal financial performance.

# Course 5: Business Analytics Capstone Project
- Apply what you've learned about making data-driven decisions to a real business challenge faced by global technology companies like Yahoo, Google, and Facebook.
- Devise a course of action to optimize your company data to provide insights and analyses using principles from each of the courses above.
